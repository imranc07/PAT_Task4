Part - A
Create a TV class with properties like brand, channel , price , inches , OnOFF status and volume.  Specify brand in a constructor parameter.
Channel should be 1 by default. Volume should be 50 by default.
Add methods to increase and decrease volume. Volume can't never be below 0 or above 100.
Add a method to set the channel. Let's say the TV has only 50 channels so if you try  to set channel 60 the TV will stay at the current channel.
Add a method to reset TV so it goes back to channel 1 and volume 50. (Hint: consider using it from the constructor).
It's useful to write a status that returns info about the TV status  like: "Panasonic at channel 8, volume 75".
